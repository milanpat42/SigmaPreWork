The terms global and local scope is used in coding to refer to the accessibility of variables to a function or operation in your code. Variables defined within a function are local variables, this means they are exclusive to the function and are only available and defined locally (within the function). Global scope is variables defined outside of functions and is available to be called wherever in the code. Changes made to a global variable in a function are also permanent and are visible to all other parts of the code.
